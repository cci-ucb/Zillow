    "    - Note: the space allocated to this directory is very small, so large files will not fit here.\n",
    "    - You can access this via the Terminal or Folder\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Store most of your work, big files, and data in your scratch partition. Keep mind of your storage use as other people are using these servers as well. Do not hog all the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - To create your scratch partition (in File Systems) go to: /scratch/public\n",
    "    - In this directory, create a folder and name it appropriately. This is where you will store most of your work.\n",
    "    - You can access this via the Terminal or Folder\n",
    "    - This directory is PUBLIC unlike the PRIVATE directory from above (2)\n",
    "    - Able to store much more files and data in this directory unlike above (2)"
