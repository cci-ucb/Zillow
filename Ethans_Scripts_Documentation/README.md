This folder contains a lot of the work that I have done for the zillow project


Combining Transaction and Assessment Data How-to Guide.ipynb is a legacy document, it should not be used for conversions anymore. A better method is documented in sqlite_documentation.md

Trans and Asmt Data to Database.ipynb is useful to get the collumns of the sqlite table, this way we can have the correct collumn formats (this way the files are as small and efficient as possible). Instructions for this are done in sqlite_documentation.md
